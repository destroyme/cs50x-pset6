Source code of the sixth problem set in the CS50x course utilizing the C programming language.

This was one of the hardest points in the course. The point of the problem set was to implement a data structure of your choice, and optimize the code's running time. 

'speller.c' is a spell-checker at it's core. It loads a dictionary into memory, and then checks the inputted text against the dictionary to see if there are any misspellings. The data structure of choice is a trie. :)
